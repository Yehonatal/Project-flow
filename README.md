# FLOW (OLD REACT VERSION)

Inspired by: [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/ambient-chaos/)

Always listened to ambient sounds while doing most my work so I was looking to make something I would use every day rather then searching through the internet every time I sat down to code or study. which got me to [ambient-chaos](https://neal.fun/ambient-chaos/) one of [neal.fun](https://neal.fun/ambient-chaos/) projects but still I wanted to make my own so I guess this is my version.
